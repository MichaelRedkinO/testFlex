        Cattle (Bos taurus) are large, domesticated, bovid ungulates widely kept as livestock. They are prominent modern members of the
        subfamily Bovinae and the most widespread species of the genus Bos. Mature female cattle are called cows and mature male cattle 
        are bulls. Young female cattle (heifers), young male cattle (oxen or bullocks), and castrated male cattle (steers) are all colloquially 
        called "cows". Cattle are commonly raised for meat, for dairy products, and for leather. As draft animals, they pull carts and farm implements. 
        In India, cattle are sacred animals. Small breeds such as the miniature Zebu are kept as pets.
